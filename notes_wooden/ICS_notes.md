# Introduction
## ICS industrial control systems
- subset of OT cpu monitoring and control fo industrial pocesses often in real-time and possibly geographically dispersed.
## Distribution industries

### SCADA

WAN `
LAN
implied hybrid solution
more latency 
local 


ICS operations and COmponents
hmi 
Remote diagonstics and maint. ::= analytics

controller - mc asic fpga 
actuators
sensors
controlled process

Control Timing Requirements
requirement is time sensitive minimal delay tight loop of control
embedded as close as possible
